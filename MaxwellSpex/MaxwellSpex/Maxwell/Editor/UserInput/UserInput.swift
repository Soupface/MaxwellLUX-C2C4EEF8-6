//
//  A New LUX
//  We dream with a world where human values are paramount for technological development, a future awoken by the renaissance of mankind awareness through a reconquered love for Art.
//  Creativity is a pathway born from the individual language of dreams to the unreachable destination of collective understanding. Through this paradoxical reflection, Art shines at the depth of stars as an eternally distant purpose.
//  Computers, software development and our digital reality had been driven by industrial and economic development. In just a lifetime, a tiny bit of humanity reached an unprecedented wealth sustained through technological advancements, but also rendering the abysmal inequality that reigns in present times.
//  For this reason, a world where technology serves humanity above all measure and profit, is the future where art blossoms. A future where creativity is unleashed, a step closer to our unreachable destination as the only known wardens of life and awareness.
//  Crafting intelligence shall be reconsidered as an artistic endeavor. The responsibility of crafting software and artificial intelligences that overpass the computational power of any average human is a god like power that corrupts when serving a selfish purpose...
//  For a future generation of code artists that wields this infinite power, a new breed of sensitive and prepared wizards that reclaim the true power of magic, for the ones that see beyond white light,  but every color from the electromagnetic spectrum, this artwork is crafted with much love for you and each of them.
